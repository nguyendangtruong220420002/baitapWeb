        <p>Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball.
            Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion</p>

        <p>My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water
            run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament.</p>
