            <img src="../nguyendangtruong_20062481/cuoi.jpg" alt="iincon cuoi" width="80", height="80"> I am a high school student. I go to school every day from Monday to Saturday. I am very busy with my studies. Sunday is my holiday. On Sunday morning, I get up later than usual. After breakfast, I come to my close friend’s and we often go shopping in the downtown areas. Sometimes we go on a picnic in the countryside.
            In the afternoon, I prefer having a rest in my room, reading books or listening to pop music. Then after dinner, I prepare my lessons for the following weekdays and go to bed early. Once in a while, I spend my weekend joining the social activities organized by the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union of my school. We usually go along the streets raising money for charity or travel to remote areas to give help to poor people.
